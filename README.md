# Libft

Libft is a personal study project in Ã‰cole 42 in which I re-implemented various functions from the standard C library. The main goal of this project was to reinforce my foundational computer science knowledge and programming skills by manually implementing common standard library functions.

## Goals

By manually coding standard library functions, I aimed to:

- Deepen my understanding of how basic library functions are structured and executed.
- Strengthen my skills and fluency in the C programming language.
- Enhance debugging and problem-solving abilities.
- Explore memory management concepts and algorithm efficiency in-depth.

## Installation

Clone this repository and build with provided Makefile:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yonaim/libft.git
cd libft
make
```

The `libft.a` library will be created after compilation.

## Usage

Include the `libft.h` header file and link the library in your C projects:

```c
#include "libft.h"
```

Compile your code with the libft library:

```bash
gcc yourfile.c -L. -lft -I includes -o yourprogram
```
